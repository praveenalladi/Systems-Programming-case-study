# Systems-Programming-case-study

The program listfilesandsizes.py will take a mount point as an input and return a list of all the files on the mountpoint and their disk usage in bytes in json format. 

The program will prompt for user input when it executes. The result will be displayed on the screen - only the files in the given directory and its size.

The program also has code that can be uncommented if files in the sub-directories need to be included and teh output to be written into a file.
